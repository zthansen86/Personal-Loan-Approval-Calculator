# Background
#### Credit Card Approval Prediction for Machine Learning 
In the financial industry, credit card scores are commonly used for risk assesment. Using [loan_data.csv](https://github.com/zthansen86/Project-4/blob/main/Resources/application_record.csv](https://github.com/zthansen86/Project-4/blob/main/loan_data.csv) the probability of future defaults and borrowing pattens can be reasonably using supervised machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest classifier.
