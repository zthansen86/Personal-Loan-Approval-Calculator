# Background
Credit Card Approval Prediction for Machine Learning 
In the finacial industry, credit card scores are commonly used for risk assesment. Using the combination of personal information [application_record.csv](https://github.com/zthansen86/Project-4/blob/main/Resources/application_record.csv) and credit data [credit_record.csv](https://github.com/zthansen86/Project-4/blob/main/Resources/credit_record.csv), the probability of future defaults and borrowing pattens can be reasonably using supervised machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and random forest classifier.
